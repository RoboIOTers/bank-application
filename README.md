# bank-application
This is a simple banking application in Java.

This is one of the first applications I developed in Java in year 2006. This application is also the reason why I developed a love for coding
I was a class 9th student and I had just started to learn Java. in those times we had almost no access to internet so bought for myself one book "the complete Java reference" and almosr finished the book.
All the things that I could learn and grasp at that stage of my age, i tried to implement in this simple banking application.

Today after many years , I found its code in my email archive, and felt nostalgic to share it here.
